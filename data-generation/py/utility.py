class UtilityModel:

    def __init__(self,name):
        '''
        This class calculates the churn probability for a customer based on their event counts.  Its called a "Utility
        Model" to mean utility in the economic sense: How much a good or service to satisfies one or more needs or
        wants of a consumer. So how likely the customer is to churn depends on how much utility they get, which is
        based on how many events they have from the behavior model.

        The parameters of the utility model are loaded from a file.  The current implementation loads a file with the
        same form as the behavior model: a vector and a matrix.  The number of these must match the number of
        behaviors in the behavior model. The vector is for calculating multiplicative utility: Each element is multiplied
        by the number of events to get the model utility from those behaviors. The matrix is unused as of this time,
        but the idea was that a second term could be added with the matrix defining utility interactions between the
        behaviors. The utility is calculated in the function `utility_function`

        The churn probability is a sigmoidal function based on utility - see the function `simulate_churn`.
